About Prob 140
A. Adhikari
Prob 140 (formally STAT 140) is a probability course for undergraduates who have taken Data 8, have a math background, and wish to go deeper into the theory of data science.

It is a course in probability theory, not data analysis. Python labs are used to better understand the theory, but the work in the course is primarily mathematical.

Prob 140 aims to give students a good theoretical background for modern data analysis. Contents have been selected after consultation with faculty who teach Stat and CS courses in advanced statistical topics including machine learning. The main topics of the course are univariate and multivariate distributions, conditioning, and some stochastic processes. Primary examples include Bayesian estimation, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, multiple regression and the geometry of the multivariate normal.
